#### React

During my time at Helcim I have been working with Vue, but had not had much experience with React. I thought this would be a good opportunity to learn a new framework.

#### Typescript

During my time as a developer I have really began to appreciate the benefits of using a typed language. After transitioning to Golang from PHP I have really enjoyed the benefits of having a type system, and choosing Typescript for this project was an obvious choice.

#### Yarn

I have been using NPM for a long time, but I have been hearing a lot of good things about Yarn. I wanted to give it a try and see if it was worth switching over.

I was especially interested in Yarn Berry, which is a new version of Yarn that works quite differently than the previous versions. I wanted to see if it was worth switching over to this new version. I found that it was not quite ready for production use, but I am excited to see where it goes in the future. I am hoping that it will eventually be able to replace NPM completely. I especially like the idea of removing the node_modules folder from the project, and creating offline caches of the dependencies.

#### Vite

I have experimented a little bit with Vite in the past while working with vue, but I have never used it with React. I wanted to see how well it works, and if it would be a good replacement for Webpack.
