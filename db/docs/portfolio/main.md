# VsCode Style Portfolio

[Technologies]()

## Objective

To create a portfolio website done in a creative way. I want to show off my skills and experience in a way that is unique and fun.

## Requirements

### Modular

I wanted to build something that was modular in a way that I could easily add content and link to new projects that I work on in the future.

### New Technologies

I wanted to challenge myself to only use technologies that I have not previously had experience with.
