# VsCode Style Portfolio

## Objective

To create a portfolio website done in a creative way. I want to show off my skills and experience in a way that is unique and fun. It can also serve as a place to experiment with new technologies and ideas. I also find myself reaching back on past projects to help mentor new developers, so I want to make sure that I have a good examples to point them to.

## Requirements

### Modular

I wanted to build something that was modular in a way that I could easily add content and link to new projects that I work on in the future. I want this to be a platform for which I can easily add new content and features.

### New Technologies

I wanted to challenge myself to only use technologies that I have not previously had experience with. I want to continue this trend with new projects that I work on in the future.
