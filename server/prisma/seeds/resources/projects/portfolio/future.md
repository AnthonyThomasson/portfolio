# The Future

## Features

### Mobile

I want to make this site mobile friendly. The vscode theme right now does not look great on mobile, but I think if I design the markdown system properly I should be able to make it fully functional on mobile.

### File References

I want to save all files with a unique reference, so that I can build links between the files within the content of the markdown.

### Admin Section

Right now all content is populated on publish from a static directory. I want to build an admin section that will allow me to create and edit content from within the application. I might allow edits to the content of the markdown files but prevent saves. This way i can show off the feature without allowing users to edit the content.

### Email

I want to hook the website up to some emailing service so that I can get emails on "git commit".

## Bugs

### Same Named Tabs

When you select a file with the same name as an active tab, there will be two tabs with the same name. I want to build a similar system to how VSCode handles this, where it will append the path to the file in the name.
