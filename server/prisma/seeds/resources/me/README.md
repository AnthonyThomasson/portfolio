# About Me

I am born and raised in Calgary, currently living in the downtown area. I love watching movies and hanging around downtown drinking coffees. I'm really into all types of racquet sports especially badminton and squash.

# Professional Background

I graduated from Mount Royal University in 2016 with a Bachelors of Computer Information Systems. After graduating highschool I was sure I was going to pursue some kind of business degree, but decided last minute to enroll in the BCIS program which allowed me to take both computer science and business classes. I found my passion in software development very quickly. I did everything I could to get through my business classes as fast as possible so that I could focus on software development.
